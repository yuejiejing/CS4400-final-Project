# CS4400-final-Project
Analyze, specify, design, implement, document and demonstrate an online system. You are required to use the classical methodology for database development. The system will be implemented using a relational DBMS that supports standard SQL queries. You will use your localhost MySQL Server (Version 5.1 or above) to implement your database and the application. We will also provide you with a list of approved technologies for your implementation, and the professor must approve the use of any other alternative technologies. Under no circumstances can you use a tool that automatically generates SQL or automatically maps programming objects into the database. You also cannot use any other software like Access or SQLite. Ask the professors or TAs if you have questions about which tools/languages/software are allowed.
